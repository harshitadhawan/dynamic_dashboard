# graph project
Dynamic dashboards provide a visual interface to consolidate diverse data sets into representations in the form of graphs for informative and interactive depiction. Dashboards aim at enhancing flexibility for the user by providing a user friendly interface where they can filter and visualize relevant information by selecting the data source, choosing the statistical graphic type and defining the data ranges. It incorporates a bunch of statistical graphics like pie charts, bar graphs, histograms, line charts, tables, etc. The data will be imported from data sources like MS Excel, MS Access, etc. using predefined templates. For interim storage, arrays will be used, and then the data will be stored in MySQL database. These report templates can be saved for later use as well
